Lofi Lens — Aesthetic Photobooth
“Capture the vibe, not just the photo.”

Lofi Lens is a web‑based photobooth inspired by Polaroid strips, Tumblr aesthetics, and cozy café vibes. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it lets you snap webcam shots, apply dreamy filters, and export them as Polaroid or film‑style contact sheets — all while listening to lofi beats.
